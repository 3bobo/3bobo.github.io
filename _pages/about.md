I’m currently a Ph.D. candidate in Northeastern University (China), supervised by Prof. [Zheng Fang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/fangzheng/zh_CN/index.htm). Before that, I received my master's degree and bachelor’s degree from the Northeastern University (China) in 2020 and 2017 respectively.

My research interests focus on 3D computer vision and deep learning, especially the 3D object tracking, 3D object detection and autonomous driving / robotics related topics.
